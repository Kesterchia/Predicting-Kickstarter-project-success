# About this project:

Kickstarter is an online crowdfunding platform for entrepreneurs to obtain a "kick-start" in capital for their project ideas. 

Individual project ideas are uploaded onto the Kickstarter website, where consumers can view information about the project including production plans, budgets and monetary goals. Each project must then reach it's respective monetary goal before it's deadline, which can be anywhere between 1 to 60 days from the project's creation.

Kickstarter adopts an "all-or-nothing" approach to funding, which means that if a project doesn't hit it's goal by the deadline, it receives no funds and is deemed a failed project. 
 
### Estimating the number of backers needed to have a successful kickstarter campaign

This project aims to deliver some insights into how much support from backers a kickstarter project would need to have a decent chance of success. The end goal is to develop a tool that would allow an entrepreneur to have a reasonable estimate of how different expected numbers of backers can affect his chances of success.
